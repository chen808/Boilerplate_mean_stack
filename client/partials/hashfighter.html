				<p>Utilizing Adobe Illustrator to construct a mockup based on the UI prototype. At this stage, the layout is becoming clear and the decision was made to prominently give the tweets more real estate because it is a community driven web app that encourages users to voice their opinions.

				Design was heavily inspired by old boxing promotional posters. Features such as "Top 10 Fighters", "Vote for Upcoming Matches", and "Fighter Profile" were added.

					<p>The initial solution was to 'bottleneck' the incoming tweets in Node to search for any repeats. Also the timer was increased to allow the animation to take effect.</p>
